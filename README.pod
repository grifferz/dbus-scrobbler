=head1 DESCRIPTION

I noticed that scrobbling from my media player (Banshee) broke a few weeks ago.
Banshee is written in Mono, which I have no idea about, and I'm pretty sure the
problem is with Banshee, not Last.fm (although Last.fm B<did> change their site
around).

Many modern media players such as Banshee, VLC, Audacity, XMMS2, Spotify, … now
support a thing called the Multimedia Player Remote Interfacing Specification
(MPRIS). It's a DBus interface so that third-party programs can control and
inspect the media players in some documented way. I decided to use it to
scrobble from. That's what this does.

B<dbus-scrobbler>:

=over 4

=item * Looks on your user session's DBus for an existing Banshee process to listen to. If it doesn't find one then it waits for one to appear.

=item * Asks for authorization with Last.fm the first time this is necessary, asking the user to complete the authorization of the application in their web browser if needed, and caches this session key forever.

=item * Updates the currently playing track on each track change and then scrobbles the previous track.

=back

=head1 SESSION KEY AND AUTHORIZATION

Updating the currently-playing track and scrobbling a track both require
authorization with Last.fm's API. The first time that B<dbus-scrobbler> is run
and has occasion to send an update to Last.fm, it will look for the
B<File::HomeDir::my_home()/.config/dbus-scrobbler/sessionkey> file.

If this doesn't exist or is empty then a URL for the user to authorize the app
will be printed, and (assuming successful authorization then takes place), the
resulting session key will be stored in the file. As this session key is valid
for an infinite period of time and allows modification of your Last.fm account
you should keep it safe.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<Net::LastFMAPI>, from which all of the code for interacting with Last.fm's
API was stolen.

=head1 BUGS

Some of the most egregious shortcomings:

=over 4

=item * Hard-coded to support Banshee.

Multiple media players support MPRIS, but I don't know enough about DBus yet to
work out how to wait for them all to appear on the bus, so at the moment this
just looks for Banshee. It should be very very simple to alter it to work with
another player though.

=item * Should run as a daemon.

It really shouldn't be foreground on the terminal. It should be automatically
launched by the user's login process.

=item * Should have proper logging.

Instead of a bunch of crappy prints this should really have logging with
multiple priorities, possibly to syslog, and at least with an option to run in
foreground and log to stderr.

=item * DBus stuff could no doubt be better.

I've knocked this together in one evening because my scrobbling was broken. I
didn't know anything about DBus before that, other than that it's a message
bus. So the chances are I have done some really stupid things.

=item * Should use own API credentials.

Last.fm's API key application page was broken when I was writing this, so I
just copied Net::LastFMAPI's credentials. That works fine but I should really
use proper credentials once the page works again.
